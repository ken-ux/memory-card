# memory-game

This is a web implementation of a memory game built with React. The main goals of this project were to use hooks to manage and utilize state while fetching and using data from an external API. The [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) was used for this project.

## How to Play

Clicking on a Pokémon gives you a point. You gain more points by consecutively clicking Pokémon that you haven't before. To win the game, you need to click all the Pokémon once without breaking the chain.

## Lessons Learned

- Using side effects to fetch from an API and synchronize data inside of components.

## Future Considerations

- An idea for further implementation is allowing the user to choose how many or which Pokémon they want to have in the game could make for more variable, fun gameplay.
